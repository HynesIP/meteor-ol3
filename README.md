meteor-ol3
==========

A wrapper around OpenLayers 3 for Meteor.js

At the moment it only provides the `ol3` symbol on the client and the necessary stylesheets.

This is based on the OpenLayers [v3.0.0](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/releases/tag/v3.0.0) release.

Installation
---

```sh
$ meteor add alon:ol3
```

There are currently no real tests.

If you think of any useful functionality, don't hesitate to open an issue.
